<h1>About</h1>


<p>I discovered my passion for technology as a child when my father taught me how to build remote-controlled<br />
model cars and boats. I was immediately fascinated by the way you could create something functioning and alive<br />
from individual parts. This enthusiasm for technology took on a new dimension when I got my first PC for my<br />
twelfth birthday. For financial reasons, I received parts instead of a finished device, which I assembled myself.<br />
It took a whole day to assemble all the components correctly, and of course there were some failures. But the moment<br />
when the fans started spinning and the flashing LEDs brought the PC to life, was the beginning of a new passion for me.</p>
    
<p>My professional career got off to a practical start when I began training as a bodywork mechanic, which I later abandoned.<br />
I worked for many years as an electrician and as an air conditioning and ventilation technician. During this time, I gained<br/>
extensive experience. I learned new things every day and honed my skills from both a technical and social perspective.<br />
I built prototypes for industrial chargers, laid hundreds of kilometers of different cable types, built network centers, led teams<br />
and trained employees - simply because I was good at it. But the fascination for IT always remained an integral part of my life.</p>
    
<p>Over the years, I kept working on private IT projects in my spare time, which took me deeper into the digital world. Eventually I<br />
decided to turn this passion into a career. I began training as an IT specialist for application development - and quickly realized that programming<br />
was exactly what I was looking for. It allowed me to continue creating and constructing things, even if this time they would be made of bits and bytes.</p>
